- Strategic and analytical thinking requirements

### 2. Educational Value
Each question includes:
- Detailed explanations for learning
- Cultural sensitivity and accuracy
- Real-world relevance and applications
- Progressive difficulty within each region

### 3. Balanced Representation
- Equal question distribution across regions
- Diverse geographical and cultural coverage
- Fair representation of different continents
- Inclusive of both major and smaller nations

### 4. Interactive Challenge Design
- Multiple-choice format with 4 options each
- Engaging "Challenge Puzzle" questions requiring synthesis
- Progressive difficulty to maintain player engagement
- Meaningful wrong answers that teach concepts

## API Integration

The questions integrate seamlessly with the existing Atlas Agent API:

```javascript
// Example API response structure
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "generated_id",
      "question": "Agent, your mission briefing indicates...",
      "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
      "correctAnswer": "Option B",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "region": "europe"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Frontend Compatibility
